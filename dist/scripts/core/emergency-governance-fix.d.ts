/**
 * ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY GOVERNANCE FIX SCRIPT
 *
 * This script provides immediate relief for the governance system
 * by bypassing the failing cron job mechanism completely.
 *
 * CRITICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED:
 * 1. Blocking I/O causing missed cron executions
 * 2. High CPU usage preventing automated voting
 * 3. Resource exhaustion from batch processing
 * 4. Poor timeout handling causing system hangs
 *
 * USAGE:
 * npm run emergency-fix
 *
 * This script can also be called directly:
 * npx ts-node scripts/emergency-governance-fix.ts
